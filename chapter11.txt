#Chapter 11. the Linux file tree

#11.2.
man hier -> filesystem hierarchy

#11.3. the root directory /
ls /

#11.4. binary directories
#11.4.1. /bin
it contains binaries for use by all users
ls /bin

#11.4.2. other /bin directories
ls /home/user_name/bin

#11.4.3. /sbin
it contains binaries to configure the OS

#11.4.4. /lib
it contains shared libraries( often used by /bin and /sbin)
/lib/modules ->Linux kernel loading modules from here
/lib32 and /lib63

#11.4.5. /opt
it stores optional software

#11.5. configuration directories
#11.5.1. /boot
it contains all files needed to boot the computer

#11.5.2. /etc
it contains all of the machine-specific configuration files

/etc/init.d/ -> contains scripts to start and stop daemons
/etc/X11/ -> graphical display
/etc/skel/ -> this directory is copied to the home directory of a newly created user
/etc/sysconfig/ -> for Red Hat

#11.6. data direcotires
#11.6.1. /home
it store personal or project data

#11.6.2. /root
default location for personal data and profile of the root user

#11.6.3. /srv
used for data that is served by your system

#11.6.4. /media
it contains all removable devices

#11.6.5. /mnt
it should be empty and should be used for temporary mount points

#11.6.6. /tmp
it should be used to store temporary data when needed

#11.7. in memory directories
#11.7.1. /dev
it is populated with files as the kernel is recognising hardware

common physical devices -> common hardware such as hdd are represented by device files in /dev
ls /dev/sd*
ls /dev/hd*

/dev/tty  -> terminal or console attached to the system
/dev/pts -> terminal which is part of the GUI like Gnome or KDE

/dev/null -> blacl hole (anything written here will be discarded)
it is useful to discard unwanted output from commands

#11.7.2. /proc conversation with the kernel
it is a view of what the kernel manages, also it is /proc filesystem
ls -al /proc/cpuinfo
file /proc/cpuinfo
cat /proc/cpuinfo

/proc/interrupts -> displays the interrupts
/proc/kcore -> physical memory is represented here ( size is same as your physical memory + 4 bytes)
ls -lh /proc/kcore

#11.7.3. /sys Linux 2.6 hot plugging
/sys -> contains kernel information about hardware
Since 2.6 kernel, linux uses sysfs to support usb nad IEEE 1394(FireWire) hot plug devices. 


#11.8. /sur Unix System Resources

#11.8.1. /usr/bin -> it contains a lot of commands
ls /usr/bin | wc -l

#11.8.2. /usr/include -> contains general use include files for C.
ls /usr/include/

#11.8.3 /usr/lib -> contains libraries that are not directly executed by users or scripts
ls /usr/lib | head -7

#11.8.4 /usr/local -> it can be used by an administartor to install software locally
ls /usr/local/

#11.8.5. /usr/share -> contains architecture independent data
ls /usr/share/ | wc -l
du -sh /usr/share/
/usr/share/man -> manual pages
ls /usr/share/man
/usr/share/games -> for  all static game data(high-scores or play logs)
ls /usr/share/games

#11.8.6. /usr/scr -> recommended location for kernel source files
ls -l /usr/scr

#11.9. /var variable data

#11.9.1. /var/log -> serves as a central point to contain all log files.
ls /var/log

#11.9.2. /var/log/syslog -> contain information on what just happened to the system
tail /var/log/syslog

#11.9.3 /var/cache -> contain cache data for several applications
ls /var/cache/

#11.9.4 /var/spool -> contains spool directories for mail and cron, but also serves as a parent drectory for other spool files

#11.9.5. /var/lib
The /var/lib directory contains applications state information

#11.9.6. /var/..
/var/run/ -> contains ProcessID(PID) files
/var/tmp/ -> contains temporary files that survive a reboot
/var/lock/ -> contains information about file locks


#11.10. practice:
1.  ls /bin/cat
    file /bin/cat
    ls /bin/dd
    file /bin/dd
    ls /bin/echo
    file /bin/echo
2.  ls -lh /boot/vm*
3.  mkdir ~/test
    cd ~/test
    dd if=/dev/zero of=zeroes.txt count=1 bs=100
    od zeroes.txt
    /dev/zero -> providing null characters, typically it's using  to provide a character stream for initializing data storage
4.  dd if=/dev/random of=random.txt count=1 bs=100
    od random.txt
    /dev/random ->providing random numbers
5.  ls -l /dev/sd* /dev/hd*
    ls -l /dev/tty* /dev/input/mou*
    first is block device, Driver communicates with it by sending entire blocks of data
    second is Character Device, driver communicate with it by sending and receiving single characters(e.g. bytes, octets)
6.   cat /etc/hosts -> mapping hostnames to IP addresses
     cat /etc/resolv.conf -> configure system's DNS resolver
7.   ls -al /etc/skel   -> only hidden
8.   ls -al /etc/skel   -> 64
9.   cat /proc/interrupts 
     du /proc/interrupts
10.  sudo su cd /root
     ls -a  -> only hidden files
11.  Because /sbin keeps all secure binaries not ordinary
    ls /sbin/ | grep ifconfig
    ls /sbin/ | grep fdisk
    ls /sbin/ | grep parted
    ls /sbin/ | grep shutdown
    ls /sbin/ | grep grub-install   -> this not
12. file /var/log
    file /var/spool
13. next command prompts(ctrl-shift-t)
    (1) who am i
    (2) who am i
14. man 4 random
